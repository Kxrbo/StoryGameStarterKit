# StoryGameStarterKit

Welcome to the Story Game Starter Kit
This Kit contains:

A awesome vehicle (Does not drive)
Joining Queue Script
High quality seats!
A Exit Button that works!*
A teleportation to the game place of your choice


Have Fun while playing around with it.
I added to every script a short description + some explanations

Disclamer: This is not supposed to be a full scripted game
It's for education so people can learn some basic things. Don't ask me
to make a full version of it. I won't. If you got specific questions, feel free
to ask, I won't bite you. 

* Also if a player Exit the Queue they will still be teleported. You also
have to find out how it works and implement it. (First Task hehe)

Once again, this is for education and not to get you a complete finished game
